# 🔧 15 Days of Verilog Fundamentals

Welcome to **15 Days of Verilog Fundamentals** – a learning and sharing challenge aimed at mastering the building blocks of digital logic design using **Verilog HDL**.

Over 15 days, I’ll be implementing and simulating core digital components, ranging from simple logic gates to a complete ALU, using **Icarus Verilog**, **GTKWave**, and **VS Code**.

> ⚡ **Follow along if you're an ECE student, a VLSI enthusiast, or diving into RTL Design!**
