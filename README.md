# 15 Days of Verilog Fundamentals 🚀
🚀 A 15-day hands-on challenge to master Verilog HDL through daily RTL design tasks, testbenches, simulations, and waveform analysis using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave. Ideal for ECE students and hardware enthusiasts!

This repository contains daily Verilog HDL exercises and simulations as part of my 15-day challenge to strengthen RTL design skills.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Icarus Verilog (iverilog)
- GTKWave
- VS Code / Any text editor

## 📅 Daily Progress
| Day | Topic                         | Status |
|-----|-------------------------------|--------|
| 1   | Hello Verilog                 | ✅ Completed |
| 2   | Logic Gates                   | ⏳ In Progress |
| 3   | Half Adder                    | 🔒 Locked |
